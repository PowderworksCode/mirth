# Which parts of the compiler run

`fixtures/sink` covers Rust's grammar ([`grammar.md`](grammar.md)); this measures how much of
the compiler compiling it reaches. mirth-watch's `[coverage]` mode (`rustc/coverage.toml`)
instruments every function and closure of the compiler's own crates (`rustc_*`) with one call
at entry, which records the function's first call in each process; at exit each rustc
process writes the functions it entered. `rustc/coverage.py` joins those with the site
tables.

    MIRTH_RUST=<rust checkout> BUILD_DIR=<dir> MIRTH_WATCH=rustc/coverage.toml rustc/build.sh
    MIRTH_OUT=<logs> RUSTC=<dir>/<host>/stage1/bin/rustc cargo build   # any number of builds
    rustc/coverage.py --sites <dir>/mirth-sites --logs <logs> [--files] [--unhit rustc_borrowck]

The instrumented compiler is the same source as `rustc-verify12` (pinned nightly plus the
local patches); 72,774 functions in 80 crates.

## Sink: a clean build, an incremental rebuild after an edit, and a run

27 rustc processes; **26454 of 71649 functions ran (36.9%)**. The largest crates:

| crate | ran | functions | |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `rustc_middle` | 5002 | 10787 | 46% |
| `rustc_query_impl` | 1423 | 4576 | 31% |

| `rustc_type_ir` | 1293 | 2750 | 47% |
| `rustc_hir_typeck` | 793 | 2559 | 31% |
| `rustc_trait_selection` | 424 | 2533 | 17% |

| `rustc_span` | 667 | 1265 | 53% |
| `rustc_metadata` | 731 | 1232 | 59% |

Not run at all: `rustc_public` (stable MIR, for tools), `rustc_sanitizers`, `rustc_transmute`
(`TransmuteFrom` checks), `rustc_thread_pool` (only with `-Zthreads`), the proc-macro crates
(`rustc_macros` and others, which run while the compiler itself is built), `rustc_graphviz`
(MIR and dep-graph dumps).

**Errors.** Sink compiles without errors, so error reporting never runs. Of the 45,195
functions that never ran, at least 12,651 (28%) are diagnostics or error paths by name or file
(`report`, `error`, `suggest`, `lint`, `emit_`, …); in `rustc_trait_selection`,
`rustc_borrowck` and `rustc_hir_typeck` more than half. More syntax will not reach those;
programs that fail to compile, built incrementally, will.
